// const transcriptionResponse = `Hey Arnie, just two very quick questions. Just reading your email about the super deductions ending in the end of March. I recently made a Â£1400 purchase for my personal account for this laptop that is my work laptop. I was wondering if I need to do anything about that between now and the end of March. Secondly, quick question on being at these co-working, co-living spaces around the world. Is there anything I should be doing to keep track of the expenses I pay towards these co-working spaces? And if they're a co-living space where it's also set up for a work environment, is there anything I should be doing differently there? Thanks. Cheers buddy, I hope you're having a fucking cracking day.`;
